    <h1>Bridge Engine Demo</h1>
    <p>This is a demo of how the bridge engine bids and plays.</p>
    <p>Below are links to random boards which the engine played (each of the four players was a robot player).</p>
    <p>Clicking on the link you will see a detailed view of the bidding and play, what options the bots considered at each point,
    and what they "thought" the hidden hands might look like.
