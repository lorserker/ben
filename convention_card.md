# Convention Card

## General approach

2/1 game forcing

### NT openings

1NT = 15-17
2NT = 20-21
3NT = 24+

### Minor openings

1C is 3+
1D is 4+ (except if 4=4=3=2)

### Two-level opening

2C forcing
2D/2H/2S = weak two

## Leads and carding

Standard leads: highest from sequence or from inner sequence. A from AK. Top of nothing.

A lead of a small card does not show any count.

No signals of any kind are played. Small cards are played randomly.

## Style

The minimum requirements for opening, for weak twos, preempts, and overcall are quite conservative and rather old-school.

Competes quite aggressively.

Slam auctions are weird.
