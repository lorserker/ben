# Model versioning

There are three different model versions

Version 0, does not include anything about system, and assumes EW and NS is playing the same system
Model names is typical just with iterations, and could be like: gib21-1000000

Version 1, where there is included a system for NS and a system for EW.
The following systems are defined
0: No system, but allowing to use version 1 without different systems
1: SAYC as played by BEN in the UCBC-competition
99: SAYC as played by WBridge5

Typical filenames are NS1EW99-bidding-1494000, so we can identify system for NS and EW

Version 2 is an expreiment, where we add an extra bid as input, hoping for better samples
Naming convension as for version 1, but with a V2 in the name like: NS1EW99-bidding_V2-11260000

Only model version 3 is now supported
